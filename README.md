# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the systematic application of engineering principles to the development,maintainance andevaluation of software systems
1.Scability and reliability
2.Efficiency and cost reduction
3.Innovation and competitiveness
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1968-Birth of software engineering
1970s-Introduction ofthe Waterfall Model
2001-Agile Manifesto
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1-Planing-Define project scope,objectives and feasability
2-Requiremant analysis
3-Design-Create architectural and system requirements
4-Implementation-develop the software based on design
5-Testing-identify and fix defects to ensure software reliability
6-Deployment-release the software for user access
7-Maintainance-provide ongoing updates

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer-writes,tests and maintains codes for applications
                    -debugs and optimizes performance
                    -collaborates with designers and other engineers
Quality assuarance engineer-develops and executes test cases to identify bugs
                            -ensures software meets quality standards
Project manager-oversees planning,execution and delivery of projects
                -communictes with stakeolders
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs-provides a comprehesive toolset
    -improves developer productivity with code suggestions and debugging tools
    -Example-Visual Studio code
VCS -Tracks changes in source code
    -allows rollback to previous versions if issues arise
    -Example-Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1-Managing complex codebases-Use modular programming,design patterns and propper documentation
2-Tight deadlines-Follow agile methodologies
3-Debugging and communication issues-Use project management tools
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing-tests individual components
            -ensures each unit performs as expected
Intergration testing-checking how different modules interact
                    -identifies issues in data flow between components
System testing-evaluates the entire application as a whole
Acceptance testing-ensures software meets business needs before deployment

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering- The process of designing and optimizing input prompts to guide AI models towards producing desired responses
       1.Improves accuracy
       2.Enhances user experience
       3.Optimizes AI performances
       4.Customization
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  Vague prompt-"Explain science"
  Improved prompt-"Describe the threem main branches of science and provide an example of a real world application of each
1. Clarity
2. Specificity
3. Conciseness
4. Effectiveness
